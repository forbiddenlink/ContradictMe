  "position": "against_remote_work",
  "opposingBeliefs": [
    "remote work is always better",
    "offices are obsolete",
    "remote increases productivity"
  ],
  "mainClaim": "Remote work reduces innovation and breakthrough creativity",
  "evidence": "Stanford study of 10,000 software developers found 23% fewer patent filings from fully remote teams compared to hybrid teams over 2 years. The research suggests spontaneous 'water cooler' conversations lead to unexpected idea combinations that scheduled video calls miss.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Spontaneous hallway conversations enable serendipitous knowledge combination",
    "Physical whiteboard collaboration allows rapid visual iteration",
    "In-person brainstorming sessions generate 30% more novel ideas (MIT study)",
    "Proximity enables real-time problem-solving without scheduling overhead"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Study focused on R&D roles in tech sector, may not generalize to all work types",
    "Hybrid model (2-3 days in office) showed similar innovation to full in-office",
    "Results may reflect poor remote collaboration tools rather than remote work itself",
    "Cultural factors and management practices confound the results"
  ],
  "counterCounterArguments": [
    "Deep work and focused coding require uninterrupted time (favors remote)",
    "Digital collaboration tools are improving rapidly (Miro, Figma, etc.)",
    "Innovation metrics are hard to measure and attribute causally",
    "Remote work may increase diversity of ideas by enabling global hiring"
