  "evidence": "NASA economic analysis shows every $1 invested returns $7-14 in economic activity through technology transfer. GPS (space tech) generates $1.4 trillion annually in economic value. Space program spinoffs include: memory foam, cordless tools, water filtration, satellite communications, weather forecasting (saves $31 billion/year in disaster prevention). Current space economy is $469 billion, projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, creating 1.5 million high-skill jobs.",
