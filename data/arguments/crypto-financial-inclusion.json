  "mainClaim": "Cryptocurrency provides critical financial services to the 1.4 billion unbanked adults worldwide",
  "evidence": "World Bank data shows that 1.4 billion adults globally lack access to basic banking services, disproportionately affecting women (56%) and people in developing nations. In countries like El Salvador, Nigeria, and Kenya, cryptocurrency adoption has enabled peer-to-peer transactions, remittances, and savings without traditional bank infrastructure. A 2024 MIT study of 50,000 users in Sub-Saharan Africa found that crypto wallets reduced remittance costs from an average of 9% to under 2%, saving families approximately $200 annually—equivalent to two weeks of income for the median household.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Traditional banking requires government ID, proof of address, and minimum balances that exclude the poor",
    "Crypto enables smartphone-based financial services in areas without physical banks",
    "Cross-border remittances via crypto are 4-7x cheaper than Western Union or MoneyGram",
    "Provides hedge against hyperinflation in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey",
    "Women in countries with restrictive banking laws can hold assets independently"
  ],
  "limitations": "Study focused on adoption in developing nations; doesn't address volatility risks or cases of fraud in crypto exchanges. Energy consumption of proof-of-work blockchains remains a valid environmental concern. Regulatory uncertainty and technical complexity still present barriers for many users.",
  "counterCounterArguments": [
    "Volatility risk can be mitigated with stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies",
    "Newer proof-of-stake blockchains use 99.9% less energy than Bitcoin",
    "User experience has dramatically improved with intuitive wallet apps and local fiat on/off ramps"
