  "mainClaim": "Independent contractor status in gig work denies workers essential protections while giving companies control without responsibilities",
  "evidence": "UC Berkeley study of 120,000 gig workers found 73% earn below minimum wage after expenses, with zero paid sick leave, healthcare, or retirement benefits. Uber's own data leaked in 2024 showed median driver works 52 hours weekly for $9.73/hour after costs. Algorithmic management exercises employer-level control - dispatching, pricing, discipline - without corresponding duties. California's AB5 implementation increased Lyft driver compensation 30% while maintaining flexibility.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Workers bear all risk: vehicle costs, insurance, maintenance, no unemployment protection",
    "No discrimination protections - apps can deactivate workers without recourse",
    "Asymmetric information - platforms control all data about earnings and opportunities",
    "Creates two-tier labor system with second-class workers"
