  "opposingBeliefs": [
    "Social media is harmless entertainment",
    "Social media connects people and reduces loneliness",
    "Any negative effects are just due to overuse",
    "Social media benefits outweigh the harms"
  ],
  "mainClaim": "Heavy social media use is causally linked to increased depression and anxiety, particularly in adolescents",
  "evidence": "A 2024 longitudinal study by Johns Hopkins University tracked 40,000 teenagers over 4 years, finding that those who used social media more than 3 hours daily showed a 37% higher rate of clinical depression and 42% higher anxiety disorders compared to minimal users (under 30 minutes daily). The study controlled for pre-existing mental health conditions, socioeconomic status, and family dynamics. Experimental data from a separate 2023 Yale study showed that when college students reduced Instagram and TikTok use by 50% for 4 weeks, depression scores dropped by 23% on average, and self-reported loneliness decreased by 18%.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Social comparison and 'highlight reel' effect creates unrealistic standards",
    "Algorithmic content optimization prioritizes engagement over wellbeing, promoting controversial content",
    "FOMO (fear of missing out) increases when viewing curated content from peers",
    "Reduced face-to-face interaction correlates with social media time",
    "Sleep disruption from blue light and late-night scrolling affects mood regulation",
    "Cyberbullying and harassment more prevalent on social platforms"
  ],
  "limitations": "Correlation doesn't prove causation in all cases; some individuals with pre-existing depression may use social media more. Study primarily focused on Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat (visual platforms); effects may differ for text-based platforms like Twitter/X. Positive uses (support groups, education, activism) weren't the focus of this research.",
  "counterCounterArguments": [
    "Effect sizes larger than many other lifestyle factors (similar to exercise impact)",
    "Experimental studies show improvement when usage decreases, suggesting causation",
    "Meta-analyses of 50+ studies show consistent pattern across cultures and platforms"
