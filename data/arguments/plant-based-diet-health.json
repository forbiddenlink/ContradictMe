  "mainClaim": "Well-planned plant-based diets reduce risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers more effectively than omnivorous diets",
  "evidence": "The 96,000-participant Adventist Health Study-2 found vegetarians had 24% lower mortality from heart disease, 50% lower diabetes incidence, and lived 3-6 years longer than meat-eaters. A 2024 Harvard meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies (1.5 million participants) showed plant-based diets associated with 25% reduced cardiovascular mortality, 20% lower cancer risk, and 15% lower all-cause mortality. Red meat consumption increases colorectal cancer risk 18% per 50g daily (WHO classification as Group 2A carcinogen). Plant-based athletes (Venus Williams, Novak Djokovic, Lewis Hamilton) achieve elite performance. Game Changers documentary featured NFL players, Olympic cyclists showing equivalent or superior performance metrics. Protein adequacy: legumes, quinoa, tofu provide complete amino acid profiles; average American consumes 1.5x needed protein.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Position of Academy of Nutrition: plant-based diets appropriate for all life stages",
    "Lower LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI in vegetarians vs omnivores",
    "Fiber intake 2-3x higher prevents colorectal cancer and improves gut health",
    "No dietary requirement for meat; B12 easily supplemented (even meat-eaters often deficient)",
    "Environmental benefits: 75% less land use, 66% less water, 49% less GHG emissions",
    "Ethical considerations: reduces animal suffering in factory farms"
  ],
  "limitations": "Requires careful planning for B12, iron, omega-3s, vitamin D. Some people may have difficulty digesting high-fiber diets initially. Not all plant-based foods are healthy (Oreos are vegan). Individual responses vary. Supplementation may be needed. Social challenges in meat-centric cultures.",

    "Supplements are widely available and inexpensive",
