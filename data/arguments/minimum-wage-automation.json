  "position": "against",
  "opposingBeliefs": [
    "Raising minimum wage helps all low-income workers",
    "Minimum wage increases have no downsides",
    "Companies can easily afford higher wages",
    "Minimum wage doesn't affect employment"
  ],
  "mainClaim": "Raising minimum wage accelerates automation adoption and reduces entry-level employment opportunities for low-skilled workers",
  "evidence": "A 2024 University of Washington study on Seattle's $15 minimum wage found hours worked for low-wage employees fell 9%, resulting in average monthly earnings declining by $125 despite higher hourly pay. MIT research tracking 35,000 fast-food restaurants showed stores in areas with minimum wage increases were 25% more likely to install self-service kiosks within 12 months. CBO analysis estimates federal $15 minimum would eliminate 1.4 million jobs while lifting 900,000 out of poverty - net negative for employment. McDonald's CEO stated automation became cost-effective only after minimum wage surpassed $12/hour. Restaurant industry data shows 73% of operators accelerated automation plans following local minimum wage hikes. Teenage unemployment (16-19) increased 4.6 percentage points in cities one year after implementing $15 minimum, while adult unemployment remained stable.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "One-time automation cost ($35k kiosk) becomes cheaper than ongoing higher wages over 2-3 years",
    "Small businesses with thin margins (3-5%) struggle more than large corporations",
    "Entry-level positions provide skills/experience ladder; fewer positions = fewer opportunities",
    "Automation displaces workers who then compete for even fewer remaining jobs",
    "Historical pattern: every $1 increase correlates with 0.3-0.6% teen employment drop",
    "Benefits concentrate among workers who keep jobs; laid-off workers worse off"
  ],
  "limitations": "Studies show mixed results across different cities and timeframes. Some research finds minimal employment effects. Doesn't account for benefits to workers who keep jobs and earn more. Correlation vs causation issues - automation trends exist independently. Small sample sizes in some studies. Short-term vs long-term effects differ.",
  "counterCounterArguments": [
    "Gradual phase-ins can minimize shock and allow businesses to adjust",
    "Increased consumer spending from higher wages can offset costs",
    "Some automation would occur regardless of wage levels due to technology advancement"
