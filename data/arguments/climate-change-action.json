  "mainClaim": "Rapid climate action could cause significant economic disruption and disproportionately harm developing nations",
  "evidence": "World Bank analysis shows immediate fossil fuel phase-out could reduce GDP growth by 2-4% annually in developing economies, pushing 100+ million people back into poverty. Nigeria's economy relies on oil for 90% of export revenue. India's coal sector employs 13 million workers directly and indirectly. Abrupt transitions without proper planning and support mechanisms could trigger economic instability in nations least able to absorb the shock.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Developing nations contributed only 8% of historical emissions but would bear 60% of transition costs",
    "Green technology currently costs 2-3x more than fossil alternatives in emerging markets",
    "Renewable infrastructure requires rare earth minerals mostly controlled by China",
    "Energy poverty affects 789 million people who need affordable power for development"
