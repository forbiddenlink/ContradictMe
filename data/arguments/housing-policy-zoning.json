  "evidence": "Research across 200+ U.S. metro areas shows cities with strict zoning have 3.2x higher housing costs and 50% lower economic mobility. Minneapolis upzoning eliminated single-family-only zones in 2018, resulting in 18% increase in new housing construction and first rent decreases in a decade. Berkeley study estimates U.S. GDP is 9.5% lower ($2 trillion annually) due to zoning restrictions preventing workers from moving to high-productivity cities.",
