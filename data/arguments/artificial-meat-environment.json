  "position": "for",
  "mainClaim": "Cultivated meat could dramatically reduce environmental impact of food production while meeting protein demands",
  "evidence": "Oxford lifecycle analysis shows cultivated meat uses 95% less land, 78% less water, and produces 96% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional beef. Current global livestock system uses 77% of agricultural land but provides only 18% of calories. Scaling cultivated meat could free 3 billion hectares for rewilding/carbon sequestration. Good Food Institute projects price parity with conventional meat by 2030 as production scales.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Eliminates animal welfare concerns and zoonotic disease risks",
    "Precision nutrition - can optimize fatty acid profiles and reduce harmful compounds",
    "Reduces antibiotic use - livestock consume 70% of world's antibiotics",
    "Food security - decouples protein production from land/water availability"
