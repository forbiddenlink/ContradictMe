  "position": "for",
  "mainClaim": "Removing standardized tests reduces equity and makes admissions more subjective and biased",
  "evidence": "UC system study of 225,000 applicants found test-optional policies increased reliance on subjective factors that favor affluent students: recommendation letters (stronger from well-resourced schools), extracurriculars (require time/money), and GPA (varies dramatically by school quality). Test scores were the strongest predictor of first-year college success for low-income and minority students. Schools that went test-optional saw 12% decrease in low-income admits.",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Tests provide standardized measure across vastly different school districts",
    "Free test prep resources have improved dramatically (Khan Academy SAT prep)",
    "High-achieving low-income students benefit most from test score visibility",
    "Holistic review without tests amplifies implicit bias in admissions"
