  ],
  "mainClaim": "Nuclear energy is statistically the safest and cleanest energy source per unit of energy produced, with lower deaths and emissions than all alternatives including renewables",
  "evidence": "A 2024 analysis by NASA climate scientist Dr. James Hansen found that nuclear energy has prevented 1.84 million air pollution deaths globally by displacing fossil fuels. Deaths per terawatt-hour: coal (24.6), oil (18.4), biomass (4.6), gas (2.8), hydro (1.3), solar (0.02), wind (0.04), nuclear (0.01). Nuclear produces zero operational CO2 emissions and uses 0.001% the land area of solar for equivalent output. A single uranium pellet (size of a pencil eraser) produces as much energy as 1 ton of coal, 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, or 149 gallons of oil. France's 70% nuclear grid has Europe's lowest electricity costs (€0.18/kWh) and lowest carbon intensity (60g CO2/kWh vs EU average 295g).",
  "supportingPoints": [
    "Chernobyl (56 direct deaths) and Fukushima (1 radiation death) are outliers; modern reactors have passive safety systems",
    "Nuclear waste volume is tiny: all US nuclear waste from 60 years fits in one football field 10 yards deep",
    "New reactor designs (SMRs, Gen IV) are walk-away safe - shut down without human intervention",
    "Nuclear has 90%+ capacity factor vs solar 25%, wind 35%",
    "Lifecycle emissions including construction: nuclear 12g CO2/kWh vs solar 48g, wind 11g",
    "France and Sweden decarbonized grids in 15 years using nuclear"
  ],
  "limitations": "High upfront capital costs ($6-9 billion per plant). Construction takes 5-10 years. Public perception remains negative. Waste requires 10,000+ year storage (though volume is small). Proliferation risks exist but are manageable. Not flexible for load following without expensive design.",
  "counterCounterArguments": [
    "SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) reduce capital costs and construction time",
    "Waste can be recycled in Gen IV reactors, reducing storage needs 95%",
    "Public education can shift perception as climate urgency increases"
