  "mainClaim": "Universal Basic Income trials show recipients work similar hours while experiencing significant improvements in mental health, education, and entrepreneurship",
  "evidence": "Finland's 2-year UBI trial (€560/month to 2,000 unemployed) showed recipients worked 6 days more per year than control group while reporting 55% less stress and 46% less depression. Kenya's GiveDirectly study (largest UBI trial: 20,000+ people, $22/month for 12 years) found employment increased 4%, business creation up 12%, no reduction in work hours. Stockton, California pilot ($500/month, 125 recipients, 2019-2021) showed full-time employment increased from 28% to 40%, compared to 5% in control group. Recipients used money for: food (37%), utilities (23%), auto expenses (11%), NOT alcohol/tobacco (less than 1%). Y Combinator pilot in Kenya found recipients invested in education, started businesses, improved housing. Economic modeling by Roosevelt Institute shows $1,000/month UBI would grow US economy 12.56% over 8 years through increased spending.",

  "limitations": "Limited trial durations (most 1-3 years) may not reflect long-term behavior. Different results in developing vs developed nations. Funding mechanism unclear at scale. Inflation concerns if broadly implemented. Some trials had small sample sizes. Cultural factors affect outcomes.",

    "Funding via VAT, carbon tax, or automation tax is economically feasible",
    "Alaska model demonstrates political viability across decades",
    "Inflation concerns addressable through careful implementation"
