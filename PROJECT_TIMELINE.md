## Risk Management

### High Risk Items:

**1. Data Collection Takes Too Long**
- **Mitigation:** Start with automated scraping, manual curation later
- **Backup:** Focus on 5 popular beliefs with deep coverage rather than 20 shallow

**2. Agent Studio Learning Curve**
- **Mitigation:** Start with documentation, join community, ask for help early
- **Backup:** Simplify conversation flow if needed

**3. Search Quality Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Test early and often, iterate on ranking
- **Backup:** Focus on quality over quantity of results

**4. Technical Bugs Before Deadline**
- **Mitigation:** Deploy early (Week 3), test thoroughly
- **Backup:** Have recorded demo video as fallback
